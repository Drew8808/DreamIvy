Placeholder script for the DreamIvy research refresh workflow.

This script can be expanded to automate discovery of new tools,
check for updates to existing tools, and open a pull request in
the DreamIvy research repository with a summary of changes.  To
get started, you might:

* Define a list of search queries for the categories you care about
* Use APIs like Kagi or Perplexity (when available) to fetch
  recent articles and announcements
* Parse the results and compare them against existing radar entries
* Generate a markdown report and write it to `radar/` with a
  timestamped filename or update existing files
* Use GitHub's REST API to open a pull request

Currently this script does nothing except print a message.  Feel free
to replace it with your own automation.
