# Sources Directory

This directory contains the underlying references and notes that support the entries in the `radar/` directory.  Each file here should correspond to a specific tool or topic and may include:

* Raw URLs and citations
* Quoted excerpts or summarised points from articles and documentation
* Notes on forum discussions and user experiences
* PDFs or images downloaded from official sources (if permitted)

Organising sources separately keeps the radar entries concise while preserving context for future review.  When referencing a source in a radar entry, use a relative link to the corresponding file in this directory.
